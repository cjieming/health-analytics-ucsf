    "#### Intro to JSON (from [this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-json))\n",
    "\n",
    "“JSON” stands for “JavaScript Object Notation”. It’s a lightweight, text-based format, and is frequently used in conjunction with REST APIs and web-based services. You can find more details on the specifics of the JSON format at the JSON web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic structures of JSON are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of name/value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "* An ordered list of values\n",
    "\n",
    "A JSON object is a key-value data format that is typically rendered in curly braces. When you’re working with JSON, you’ll likely see JSON objects in a .json file, but they can also exist as a JSON object or string within the context of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A JSON object looks something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"first_name\" : \"Sammy\",\n",
    "  \"last_name\" : \"Shark\",\n",
    "  \"location\" : \"Ocean\",\n",
    "  \"online\" : true,\n",
    "  \"followers\" : 987 \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "JSON can store nested objects in JSON format in addition to nested arrays. These objects and arrays will be passed as values assigned to keys, and typically will be comprised of key-value pairs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In the users.json file below, for each of the four users (\"sammy\", \"jesse\", \"drew\", \"jamie\") there is a nested JSON object passed as the value for each of the users, with its own nested keys of \"username\" and \"location\" that relate to each of the users. The first nested JSON object is highlighted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ \n",
    "  \"sammy\" : {\n",
    "    \"username\"  : \"SammyShark\",\n",
    "    \"location\"  : \"Indian Ocean\",\n",
    "    \"online\"    : true,\n",
    "    \"followers\" : 987\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"jesse\" : {\n",
    "    \"username\"  : \"JesseOctopus\",\n",
    "    \"location\"  : \"Pacific Ocean\",\n",
    "    \"online\"    : false,\n",
    "    \"followers\" : 432\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"drew\" : {\n",
    "    \"username\"  : \"DrewSquid\",\n",
    "    \"location\"  : \"Atlantic Ocean\",\n",
    "    \"online\"    : false,\n",
    "    \"followers\" : 321\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"jamie\" : {\n",
    "    \"username\"  : \"JamieMantisShrimp\",\n",
    "    \"location\"  : \"Pacific Ocean\",\n",
    "    \"online\"    : true,\n",
    "    \"followers\" : 654\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, curly braces are used throughout to form a nested JSON object with associated username and location data for each of four users. Just like any other value, when using objects, commas are used to separate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can also be nested within the JSON format by using JavaScript arrays that are passed as a value. JavaScript uses square brackets [ ] on either end of its array type. Arrays are ordered collections and can contain values of differing data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use an array when we are dealing with a lot of data that can be easily grouped together, like when there are various websites and social media profiles associated with a single user.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the first nested array highlighted, a user profile for Sammy may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ \n",
    "  \"first_name\" : \"Sammy\",\n",
    "  \"last_name\" : \"Shark\",\n",
